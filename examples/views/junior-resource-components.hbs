            <strong>Goal</strong>
            <br /><br />
            In Class 22, you learned how to use the themes and color palette features in App Lab.
            In this project, you will have to practice and apply what you learned in the class and design an app to
            create your own color
            theme.

            <br /><br />
            <strong>Story</strong>
            <br /><br />
            Eva recently learned designed an app on App Lab. However, it wasn’t very appealing in its
            design and color theme.. She has been exploring App Lab to understand how to add color to the screen. She
            also wants to know how to add design elements on the screen. But she has forgotten how to do so and is
            struggling.
            Can you help Eva design the app?
